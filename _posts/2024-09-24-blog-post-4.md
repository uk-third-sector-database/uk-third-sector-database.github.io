## Overview 

This blog post outlines an example analysis carried out by linking organisations in our foundational
spine to an important source of covariate data. Our project aims to link a diverse range of data sources to
our organisational spine, including the ONS Business Index, 360Giving grant data, and trustee data held
by the charity regulators. In this blog, we link our spine to the Serious Incident Reporting (SIR) scheme
operated by the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) between April 2016 and April 2024.
This   scheme   offered   charities   a   mechanism   for   demonstrating   accountability   in   response   to
organisational incidents and crises; the intended impact of this scheme was to prevent and mitigate the
effect of serious incidents on individual charities and the wider sector. In the sections that follow, we will
provide some descriptive analyses on the type of events reported, who reports them, the type of charities
affected, and a time series analysis to show the reporting trend over the period of our data.

## Risk data

Beginning in April 2016, OSCR requested that charities report certain types of serious incidents through
its SIR scheme; these were incidents, ongoing and historical, that threatened to have a significant impact
on the charity or its assets. The SIR data we use covers the entire period of this scheme and includes
1185   reported   events.   These   events   relate   to   760   distinct   Scottish   charities   that   we   link   to   our
organisational spine. Figure 1 below provides the first overview of this data and shows the most frequent
type of events reported to OSCR.

Over 30 per cent of events relate to fraud and theft or financial issues/loss, with another 23.3 per cent
related to safeguarding or personal behaviour. It was also possible for charities to identify Covid-19 as a
threat to the organisation after the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020. We can see that 5.7% of all
events reported in this period were related to the pandemic. This data also allows us to see who reports
these events to OSCR.[^1] In the vast majority of cases, this is either a trustee (52.6 per cent) or a staff
member (41.5 per cent). The remaining six per cent of cases are reported by solicitors or independent
examiners. Table 1 adds additional detail on how these events are distributed across categories of
charitable   activity   using   a   version   of   the   International   Classification   of   Non-Profit   Organisations
scheme. This allows us to classify organisations into broader categories. Table 1 also provides data on
how   these   categories   are   distributed   across   the   Scottish   charitable   sector   as   whole   to   allow   for
comparison

[^1]: This data is missing for 162 events in the data so we base these descriptives on the 1,023 non-missing values.

Note: Figures for percentage of sector by ICNPO category is based on register of active charities in April 2023.

An interesting descriptive finding here is that charities classified as being in the ‘social services’
categories account for almost a fifth of all reported events, despite comprising just 10.6% of the
sector. Below we add one additional layer of analysis. Figure 2 shows the time trend of reported
events over the full period of the data. The numbers on the y-axis represent a count of reported
events while the x-axis represents the period April 2016 to April 2024 in monthly intervals.
Figure 2 and its associated statistical tests suggest that there is no significant time trend over the
period of our data. In other words, the number of events reported per month does not seem to be
increasing or decreasing significantly when we consider the full time period of our data.
However, there is considerable and significant variation in this measure over time and we may find
statistically significant changes in reporting rate by splitting our time period into sections of substantive
interest.

## Conclusion 

In this blog post, we have linked an important source of covariate data (the OSCR SIR scheme) to our
spine and have demonstrated how this data can be used to explore features of the Scottish charitable
sector.   By   linking   our   spine   to   several   additional   data   sources   such   as   SIR   schemes   from   other
jurisdictions, the ONS Business Index, 360Giving grant data, and trustee data held by the charity
regulators, we aim to produce a foundational database of UK third sector organisations that will allow
users to build a holistic and integrated picture of the UK charitable sector. We hope this resource will
make a significant contribution to the evidence base of the field and will be used to improve analysis of
the third sector.
