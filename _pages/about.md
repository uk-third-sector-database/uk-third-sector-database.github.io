Welcome to the home of the UK Third and Civil Society Sector Database! We are a collaborative group of researchers focusing on improving the data infrastructure for understanding and studying the third and civil society sectors in the UK. Our work collects, refines, links and publishes data on third and civil society organisations from a range of official and administrative sources. These [data resources](https://uk-third-sector-database.github.io/data/) can be used to:

- identify geographic and temporal shifts in which types of organisations are founded and dissolved;
- analyse long-run financial performance and sustainability for a wide variety of third and civil society sector organisations; and
- examine the intensity and extensity of the sector's participation in UK public procurement markets.

This work was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council [("Improving Access to and Use of Organisation-Level Data on the Third Sector and Civil Society")](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=ES/X000524/1) and Department for Culture, Media & Sport ("Mapping and Understanding the UK Civil Society Sector").

We welcome feedback and suggestions for improvements: please contact [Dr Diarmuid McDonnell](mailto:diarmuid@brawdata.com).
