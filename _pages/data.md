## About our data

This project produces a range of open data resources that support research on the UK's third sector and civil society. These resources include a comprehensive register of organisations drawn from multiple regulatory sources, longitudinal financial records for charities and nonprofit companies, and records of public procurement contracts awarded to civil society organisations. All datasets are linked through a common organisational identifier, enabling cross-resource analysis.
